ABOUT THESE SHAPEFILES

NOTE: Please consult the Climate Change Knowledge Portal at
http://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org for important details on the
proper attribution and interpretation of this data.

This shapefile archive contains gridded "ensemble" temperature and precipitation data derived
from multiple global circulation models (GCMs) as used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, for months and years in four future time periods.  Values depict the range
(10th percentile, median and 90th percentile) of model outputs for different variables,
SRES scenarios (A2 and B1), and time periods (2020-2039, 2040-2059, 2060-2079, and
2080-2099). Each shapefile includes a 10th percentile, median and 90th percentile value for
each of 12 months, plus annual values.

The name of each file denotes the data contained within it, as follows:

  avg: these files contain average monthly and annual values.

  anom: these files contain average monthly and annual changes (anomalies), relative
  to the control period of 1961-1990.

  pr: precipitation, in millimeters

  tas: temperature, in degrees Celsius

  a2: shapefile employs the A2 SRES scenario

  b1: shapefile employs the B1 SRES scenario

  2020_2039: the start and end years of the time period.

Example: anom_pr_a2_2020_2039.  This file contains precipitation anomalies
generated from the A2 SRES scenario for the 2020-2039 time period.
